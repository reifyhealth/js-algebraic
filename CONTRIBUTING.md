# Contributing to Algebraic

We’re excited that you’re interested in contributing to *Algebraic*!

Contributions include:

* contributing to discussion around the design of *Algebraic* in
  [chat](https://gitter.im/reifyhealth/js-algebraic)
* [providing an issue report or a new feature
  request](https://github.com/reifyhealth/js-algebraic/issues/new),

  form of a [pull request](https://github.com/reifyhealth/js-algebraic/pulls)),

## Contributing Work

If you’d like to contribute code, documentation, or other materials to be added
to the *Algebraic* project then we ask that you sign a contributor license
agreement (CLA). This agreement helps ensure good faith and understanding
concerning the use and licensing of *Algebraic*.

> If you are interested in contributing please contact `joseph@reifyhealth.com`
> to complete the CLA.

If your contribution is what could be considered an “obvious fix”, e.g. fixing
a spelling error, then its contribution does not require the signing of a CLA.
A contribution is considered an “obvious fix” if it introduces no new
functionality or creative thought. Examples include:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

Obvious fixes will be reviewed before acceptance. *Please clearly mark them!*

## Style Guide

ESLint will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. If you have
a specific reason for choosing different linting behavior please disable eslint
as locally as possible and leave comments explaining the reasoning.

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are
unsure about something, looking at [Airbnb's Style
Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right
direction.

### Code Conventions

* Use semicolons `;`
* Commas last `,`
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer `"` over `'`
* 80 character line length
* Write "attractive" code

### Documentation

* Wrap lines at 80 characters
